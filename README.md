# multifit
> ### Multi-scale analysis for landscape ecology

The main goal of *multifit* is to ease the process of multi-scale analysis for landscape ecologists. In this way, *multifit* allows the user to run many statistical models at the same time (i.e. one for each studied spatial scale), and visualize the output in a frienldy way. A comprehensive description of the function and of how it works is detailed in the pdf manual of this repository.

The purpose of sharing the code here on GitHub is to make it available in executable format. The GitHub site will automatically display 
the latest version of the code. You can download the code from GitHub by clicking the 'Clone or Download' button.

If you encounter any problems in using the code please email me, and I will do my best to resolve the issue. Also, if you are familiar with R-programming, you may take the code and change it to adapt it for particular purposes.
